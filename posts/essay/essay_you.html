        <h2>Why are you You?</h2>
        <p>During your life you encounter hundreds of individuals, each with their own unique stories. Some of these leave a mark on you, while others pass without notice. Have you ever paused to wonder why you are you, and not another person you have met?
            This may seem like a simple question at first which is often dismissed with a laugh and a wave of the hand, with most people stating, "Of course, I am me and they are them. We are different people." However, upon deeper reflection, its anything but simple. What actually constitutes the self and what defines the boundary between you and others?
